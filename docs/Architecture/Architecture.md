# ICE Chain

ICE chain is a truly fast, permissionless, secure and scalable public blockchain platform 
which is supported by hybrid consensus technology called Minerva and a global developer community. 
 
ICE chain uses hybrid consensus combining PBFT and fPoW to solve the biggest problem confronting public blockchain: 
the contradiction between decentralization and efficiency. 

ICE chain uses PBFT as fast-chain to process transactions, and leave the oversight and election of PBFT to the hands of PoW nodes. 
Besides, Icechain integrates fruitchain technology into the traditional PoW protocol to become fPoW, 
to make the chain even more decentralized and fair. 
 
ICE chain also creates a hybrid consensus incentive model and a stable gas fee mechanism to lower the cost for the developers 
and operators of DApps, and provide better infrastructure for decentralized eco-system.
